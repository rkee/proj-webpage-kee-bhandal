      <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
      <p>
          In this project, we decided to implement parts 1 and 2. In part 1, we implemented BSDF reflections and refractions, and used them for sampling from mirror materials (which perfectly reflect light) as well as glass materials (which both reflect and refract light). Then in part 2, we implemented support for microfacet models for more realistic rendering. We used the BSDF evaluation function presented in lecture. Instead of using a Guassian distribution for the NDF, we used the Beckmann distribution which is similar to it. Then finally, we replaced the cosine-weighted hemisphere sampling with importance sampling to reduce noise which was better suited for the Beckmann distribution.

      </p>
      <p>
        What seems to be happening here is the max_ray_depth in each image is limiting whether or not certain rays can refract through the spheres or not. As the max ray depth increases, the refraction effect in the image becomes more apparent because more rays are allowed to refract/bounce through the glass.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>
          Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the max ray depth 1 image, both spheres appear black because any rays traced from the light source and hit a sphere refract once through the sphere, but then terminates at the second bounce as the ray tries to exit the sphere. So in this case any rays that refract through the spheres cannot reach the camera. But as expected, we can still see the reflection of the light source since one bounce is allowed. For the max ray depth 2 image, refraction effects become a lot more visible for the back sphere, but only barely visible for the closer sphere. This is because now with the increased max ray depth, some refracted rays through the spheres are being allowed to reach the camera. However, since the closer sphere is in front of the light source, any rays bouncing off walls that are able to bounce off the front side of the closer sphere had already used up two bounces, so they terminate before they can reflect off the front surface into the camera. But then when the max ray depth is increased to 3, the refraction effects become visible for the front sphere because more refraction rays can reach the camera and also light bouncing off the walls can reflect off the front surface of the closer sphere.

      <p>
        As we increase $\alpha$, the surface of the dragon appears to become brighter and less "mirror-like". This makes sense since $\alpha$ represents the roughness of the material. When the surface becomes rougher, the light that is reflected off the surface will be spread more evenly according to our microfacet model which causes it to appear less "mirror-like".

      <p>
        It is clear to see that implementing importance sampling helped to reduce noise by a lot. This is because the Beckmann distribution that we used for the pdfs in importance sampling more closely resemble $D(h)$ (the NDF) than the cosine-weighted hemisphere sampling does.
